# Created new squashed migration shop/migrations/0001_initial_squashed_0026_product.py
#   You should commit this migration but leave the old ones in place;
#   the new migration will be used for new installs. Once you are sure
#   all instances of the codebase have applied the migrations you squashed,
#   you can delete them.
# Manual porting required
#   Your migrations contained functions that must be manually copied over,
#   as we could not safely copy their implementation.
#   See the comment at the top of the squashed migration for details.
# Squashed migration couldn't be formatted using the "black" command. You can call it manually.
